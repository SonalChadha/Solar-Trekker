		<h2>A Leap Forward by Integrating EVs</h2>
		<p>Though the future of fully solar-powered cars seems hopeful and possible, it is regarded as impractical or even impossible
		by many. Solar panel tech has improved, becoming more affordable and easier for consumers to install in their home. Still,
		most have been seen only in racing competitions and less in the actual market. A major limitation is that a solar panel integrated 
		into the roof of a car is too small to produce enough power needed. According to <a href="https://news.energysage.com/solar-panel-cars/" target="_blank">EnergySage</a>,
		"Given that solar panels convert sunlight to usable electricity just around 20 percent at the upper end, a car covered in solar cells might be able to produce 
		enough energy each day to power an electric car for about 20 to 25 miles. That’s assuming a full day’s worth of sunlight, no clouds, no dust blocking the solar cells, 
		and perfectly oriented solar cells on the car." This engineering project taught us a lot about what goes into building a solar-powered car, especially the scientific aspects.
		A more feasible product could be a solar-powered electric car, which could increase the efficiency by a lot. Electric and hybrid-cars are already purchased by many people today,
		and are part of a growing market. They are also the most efficient type of car. If their batteries are charged with renewable energy source like solar energy rather than nonrenewable
		coal or natural gas, the benefits multiply!

		<h2>Considering Potential Improvements for Future</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>In the initial design stages, we considered using wood, but we only thought about plywood or particle board. If we had considered a material such as balsa wood, it would have allowed us to have a very rigid frame that is both cheap and light. Balsa wood would have eliminated the need to purchase larger wheels.</li> 
			<li>No one in our group had the ability to solder which meant that all the electrical connections had to be taped, twisted, or fastened with a wire-nut. This led to connection issues throughout the testing phase that had to continually be corrected.</li> 
			<li>Due to the coronavirus keeping our group separated, many of the additional elements that we had planned to include had to be cut from the final product. Things such as lights and the ability to steer the car were not able to be fully implemented.</li>
