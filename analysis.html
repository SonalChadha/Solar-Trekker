			<h2>Key Insights</h2>
			<p>"Much like solar-powered homes, solar cars harness energy from the sun, and then convert it into electricity.
			That electricity then fuels the car's powertrain, which is similar to the combination of an electric motor and battery-based 
			energy storage that drives modern hybrid cars. Solar cars can accomplish this through photovoltaic cells (PVC). PVCs are the
			components in solar paneling that convert the sun's energy to electricity. They're made up of semiconductors, usually made of 
			silicon that absorb the light. The sunlight's energy then frees electrons in the semiconductors, creating a flow of electrons. 
			That flow generates the electricity that powers the battery or the specialized motor in solar cars."</p>

			<h2>Solar Cars Surprising Facts</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Weigh lighter than normal cars, upto 6X</li>
				<li>Toyoto Prius has been experimenting with solar-powered cars. Features
				a solar-paneled roof that acts as the car's ventilation system, but doesn't
				drive the engine. Collects and stores sun's energy even while you drive the
				car on gas</li>
				<li>Though long-night road trips can't be achieved yet, these cars have a rechargeable power bank 
				that still stores enough energy within its battery for you to drive at night or cloudy day</li>
				<li>Need little maintenance compared to gas-reliant cars, due to no moving parts. 
				Just need to be checked for dust and debris a few times each year, along with monitoring health of battery</li>
				<li>Will start out pretty costly (~ $100,000), but not unreasonably so</li>
				<li>Solar-car racing challenges held both nationally and worldwide for competition and entertainment purposes</li>

			<h1>Solar-Powered Cars With Respect to Trends in Oil Production?</h1>
			<p>According to <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/oil/" target="_blank">WorldOMeter</a>, "the world consumes 35,442,913,090 barrels of oil as of the year 2016, equivalent to 97,103,871 barrels per day.
			Global oil consumption per capita is 5 barrels of oil (199 gallons) per person yearly (based on the 2016 world population of 7,464,022,049 people) or 0.5 gallons per capita per day.
			There are 1.65 trillion barrels of proven oil reserves in the world as of 2016.
			The world has proven reserves equivalent to 46.6 times its annual consumption levels. This means it has about <b>47 years</b> of oil left (at current consumption levels and excluding unproven reserves)"	
			</p>
			<p>Our known oil deposits will only last us a few more decades if we continue with this trend. There is a slight possibility that we might discover some new oil 
			deposits. This could give us extra time, but considering that the rate at which we consume oil is not constant due to the rapidly growing populations that use the reserves,
			it is safer for us to explore into alternative renewable sources of energy before it is too late. Revolutionizing the medium that guides our commutes/travels will mitigate this 
			concern of sustainability and can be achieved via solar panels to power cars.

		<h1>Benefits and Disadvantages of Solar Technology for Cars</h1>
		<p>A solar-powered car burns no fuel and does not produce emissions. Thus, it can preserve natural resources and be pollution-free. Pollution
		is created only during the manufacturing and transportation of the solar panels/systems. This is negligible compared to pollution created by fuel-powered cars.
		The end product for solar-powered cars requires no additional energy and input.
		</p>
		<p>Since they don't depend on external fuel sources, and energy from the sun is unlimited and free, solar cars are free from fuel costs that trouble gas and diesel 
		cars. Consumers using solar energy don't have to deal with direct costs, unlike those who own electric cars and have to spend a few bucks to charge their battery 
		from the power outlet or unlike owners of gas-powered cars who spend some on purchase of fossil fuels or biofuels. 
		</p>
		<p>
		They also have high speeds due to their light, low-to-the-ground, and broad base structure. Noise levels are nonexistent due to electric motors, which are relatively 
		smaller than that of the gas engine, and usually operate without causing noise or vibrations. Maintenance for solar energy systems is low, and easily affordable.
		</p>
		<p>Power harnessed from the sun and converted into energy amounts to a modest 20% efficiency (or 20% of the energy from the sun can be used to power a solar-powered car).
		This level of energy efficiency is similar to that of conventional gasoline vehicles, which convert 12-30% of energy from gasoline to power at the wheels. Compared with electric
		cars, solar-powered cars fall short since EVs convert over 77% of the electric energy from grid to power at the wheels.
		</p>
		<img id="pic3" src="Images/analysis3.png" alt="" />
		<p>Initial cost of purchasing solar systems(panels, inverter, batteries, and wires for installation) is relatively high. People living in a house for several years can expect the savings
		they earn by going solar to compensate for their initial costs. So, installing such a system is a wise decision for those looking to settle in one place for 7-20 years (depends on state).
		</p>
		<p>Major factors inhibiting the practicality of going solar include weather dependency and high space requirements. You will have to ensure that you live in an area with lot of sunshine.
		With rainy or cloudy days, the amount of solar energy available will go down. The roof of a car has relatively small surface area. Solar panels covering the whole car produce power for only
		a couple of miles, let alone those covering just the roof. A great number of solar panels, along with reliability of strong sunlight in the area, are required to collect enough sunlight.
		</p>
		<p>Storing solar energy can be quite expensive, and can be done only through batteries. The batteries must be charged in the day, so that they can be used in the night when sun is not available. 
		</p>
		<p>Summarized in the table below are the pros and cons of a fully solar-powered car.
